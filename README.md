# Amazon-Review-Tags

### Problem Statement âš¡

<strong>Customers write product reviews on ecommerce websites like Amazon. Amazon processes the reviews to generate commonly
occurring tags. But, there exist multiple tags referring to the same thing. Create algorithm to combine review tags based on meaning.  </strong>

### What it does ðŸ¤–

We created an algorithm to extract from the reviews online we used the following dataset : [Dataset](https://bit.ly/SHPL1)
to train a Natural Language Processing model. 

### How We built it ðŸ’¡

1. We used Google Colab to create and implement the model. 
2. We used NLTK and Spacy to preprocess the review data. 
3. For training our model we used a deep learning model called Seq2Seq model to summarize the review text summarizer where the input is a long sequence of words (in a text body), and the output is a short summary (which is a sequence as well). So, we can model this as a Many-to-Many Seq2Seq problem. Below is a typical Seq2Seq model architecture:

4. After summarizing the review we extract the subjects from the summary sentences
5. <strong>Voila!! The subjects extracted from the summary is tags we were looking for!</strong> 

### Challenges we ran into ðŸ§ 

- Pre-processing the review data for model. 
- Creating the model 
- Extracting subject from summary. 

### Accomplishments that we are proud of ðŸ˜Œ

We created a fully functional algorithm to extract tags from a given review.

### What we learned ðŸ¤©

We learned basic structure of natural language processing using nltk and spaCy using Python. And creating a deep learning model Seq2Seq. 

### What's next for the project ðŸ“ˆ

#### âž¡ Creating a functional API

Deploying the model as an open source API. 

#### âž¡ Improve the NLP model. 

The accuracy of the NLP model can be increased in the future.
